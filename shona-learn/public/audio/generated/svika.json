The lower lip should visibly rise towards the upper teeth. This specific posture is key. Generate a secondary video from a profile (side) view to clearly show this lip posture.\nFor the vowel 'i', the mouth shape must be pure and static, matching the [i] sound without gliding. 'i' is a wide smile, \nFor 'k' [k], show standard articulation for this voiceless stop.\nFor the vowel 'a', the mouth shape must be pure and static, matching the [a] sound without gliding. 'a' is a wide open mouth, \n\nThe overall delivery must be rhythmically even, with equal time and emphasis on each syllable. Avoid any exaggerated facial expressions not related to articulation.",
