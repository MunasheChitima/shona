The lower lip should visibly rise towards the upper teeth. This specific posture is key. Generate a secondary video from a profile (side) view to clearly show this lip posture.\nFor the vowel 'i', the mouth shape must be pure and static, matching the [i] sound without gliding. 'i' is a wide smile, \nFor 'n' [n], show standard articulation for this nasal.\nFor the vowel 'o', the mouth shape must be pure and static, matching the [o] sound without gliding. \n\nThe overall delivery must be rhythmically even, with equal time and emphasis on each syllable.
