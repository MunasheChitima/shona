The lower lip should visibly rise towards the upper teeth. This specific posture is key. Generate a secondary video from a profile (side) view to clearly show this lip posture.\nFor the vowel 'a', the mouth shape must be pure and static, matching the [a] sound without gliding. 'a' is a wide open mouth, \nFor the vowel 'i', the mouth shape must be pure and static, matching the [i] sound without gliding. 'i' is a wide smile, \nFor 'r' [r], show standard articulation for this liquid.\nFor the vowel 'a', the mouth shape must be pure and static, matching the [a] sound without gliding. 'a' is a wide open mouth, \n\nWhen Vowel Hiatus occurs, the video must show a clear and distinct re-articulation. The mouth should fully form the first vowel shape, relax slightly, and then fully form the second vowel shape. Do not blend these movements.\n\nThe overall delivery must be rhythmically even, with equal time and emphasis on each syllable. Avoid any exaggerated facial expressions not related to articulation.",
