✅ **Stage 2: Syllabification and Phonetic Profiling**  
- CV structure analysis with vowel hiatus detection
- Detailed phonetic profiles for each phoneme
- Complexity scoring and difficulty assessment

✅ **Stage 3: Dynamic Prompt Generation**
- Specialized TTS prompts with phonetic instructions
- Video synthesis guidance with mouth position details
- Anti-pattern warnings and articulation notes

✅ **Stage 4: Execution and Asset Management**
- Production-ready API integration framework
- Comprehensive metadata generation
- File management and quality assurance
