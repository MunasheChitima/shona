## 🧠 **MUDZIDZISI AI POWERING VEO**

### **Advanced Linguistic Analysis:**
Each video generation is powered by sophisticated phonetic analysis:

**Example: "bhazi" (bus)**
- **Tokens**: [bh, a, z, i] → 4 phonetic units
- **Syllables**: bha-zi → 2 pronunciation segments  
- **Special Sound**: Breathy consonant [bʱ] with "audible sigh"
- **Complexity**: 7/10 → Intermediate difficulty
- **Visual Effect**: Gentle smoke/mist animation for breathy sound

**Example: "svika" (arrive)**
- **Tokens**: [sv, i, k, a] → Including whistled sibilant
- **Syllables**: svi-ka → Clear pronunciation timing
- **Special Sound**: Whistled [sv] with lip rounding
- **Complexity**: 8/10 → Advanced Shona phoneme
- **Visual Effect**: Sparkles and flowing particles
